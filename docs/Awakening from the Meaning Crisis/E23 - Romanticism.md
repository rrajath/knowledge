The systematic set of psycho-technologies that brought about radical transformations in the past has been religion. And yet, part of the heritage of Descartes and the scientific revolution, and the ongoing fragmentation that has followed from the protestant reformation is the increasing secularization of the world.

For many of us, the return to religion in order to provide a multi-level, multi-variant, complex transformation that is needed to meet the crises that we’re facing, it’s not available to us precisely because we’re post religious or we’re myopically entrenched within the scientific revolution that will in no way avail us with what we need in order to address these crises. So, the religious option is not a viable one.

Secular solution is also not viable. We face this problem of needing a religion that’s no religion, but cannot be fully secular and we don’t want it to be religious and it’s filled with paradoxical tension and contradiction.

Kant asks the question, "how is it that mathematics has become the language of reality? Why is it that we accept Galileo’s claim that mathematics is the language of the universe?" Kant was trying to get the two sides of Descartes together by asking "how is it that math is real and gives me access to reality, but what I really have is access to my own mind?"

Kant comes up with a radical proposal and calls it the Copernican Reversal. His proposal is, these categories, these patterns of intelligibility we find in the world, the mathematical properties, aren’t actually there; not in the sense we think they are. He basically makes the move that Occam made.

Occam’s Razor (people usually don’t understand what’s they’re saying while invoking Occam’s Razor). Occam’s Razor basically says that all these patterns of intelligibility you think are in the world are actually in your mind. What Kant says is, these ways of measuring the world mathematically, they aren’t the features of the world. They are the way in which experience has to be organized in order to make sense to the mind.

Analogy: The world is too big, it’s too much. I have to filter it (with my eyes, or *through* my eyes) in order to fit it in to my mind and make sense of it.

Kant’s idea was there are structures in the mind that act as filtering frames. They impose a structure of intelligibility on experience. What’s happening is, this pattern is being imposed on the information coming in so that it will fit my mind and make sense to my mind. And that’s the basis of my capacity to reason about the world. And I reason about the world not because the world is ultimately rationally structured, but, like Occam said, the world is absurd in itself. And I can reason about the world because I have filtered it in such a way that my mind can process it according to its own internal grammar.

This is why it’s a Copernican Reversal. I’m not discovering in the world, the mathematical properties of things. My mind is filtering and imposing a structure on them so that it can make sense and think about them. Your mind is *making sense* of things. So, math isn’t actually discovering reality. Math is ultimately about how the mind imposes a structure on reality so it can reason about it.

For Kant, we can never know the world as it is. Because our minds are not only withdrawn from the world, it’s imprisoned. Because for it to perceive the world, it has to pass through filters. As per Kant, math works so well to understand the world because that’s the grammar our minds operate under.

The better explanation of Kant-ian ideology is information passing through several filters and structures in our mind being imposed on that information. This is the most prevelant model used in cognitive psychology.

There’s bottom-up processing and top-down processing. Bottom-up is where the processing starts with perception and moves towards cognition. Top-down is starting with cognition (starting with your knowledge) and moves down to perception.

In Kant-ian worldview, as information comes in through the filters and structures are imposed upon it, it’s more and more **rational**. But as the worldview is more and more rational, it’s also farther and farther away from reality.

If I go the other way, if I open my mind up to the more irrational, less fully processed parts of cognition, the boundary between the conscious and the unconscious aspects of my experience, as I move into the imaginary, irrational, dream-like aspects of cognition, I’m going to lose rationality. But I’m gaining back that lost contact with the world. This is what Romanticism is all about.

Romanticism is the idea that we can recapture contact with reality by moving away from the rational layers of cognition and into the irrational layers. Why does that get associated with love? Because, in the neo-platonic tradition, with the romantics in this twisted way of trying to get back to gnosis and participatory knowing, in that tradition the quintessential form of participatory and perspectival knowing is love.

The faculty between perception and reason is imagination. We understand imagination as moving images in our mind. But the romantics called that fantasy. To them, imagination is how the mind imposes the structure on raw data so that it becomes available to reason. Music and art are understood to give us access through the imagination to reason. Because music and art are where the mind seems to be imposing an order in such a way that meaning is made that we can then rationally reflect upon.

In empiricism, the mind is an empty canvas and the world writes on the canvas. In romanticism, it’s the opposite. The world is an empty canvas and the mind projects its imagination on to the world. The empiricists state that the mind is a blank canvas upon which the world *impresses* itself. Romantics state that the world is a blank canvas upon which the mind expresses itself.

Romanticism appears to do what religion used to do. It integrates music, art, literature, the project of trying to find and make meaning in the scientific worldview by giving you this whole framework of how you regain contact with reality, one of the hallmarks of religious quest. You regain contact with reality by moving into the world of imagination. We can use all this machinery of religion and it irrationally takes you in contact with reality.

Romanticism is the first and it’s the godfather/godmother of all pseudo religious ideologies. The romantics get that the language can’t do it all, which is why they turn to poetry. If you don’t have any spiritual exercise, or systematic set of psycho technologies, or reliable methods and guides for these transformative experiences, then all you have in the end are the words.

When you read poems, even if you really appreciate how good the poems are, you’re not getting much from it. Because everything has been reduced to the words. The romantics didn’t give us anything else. They didn’t give us practices, they didn’t give us institutions, they didn’t give us systematic sets of psycho technologies. They give us promises, images and words. That’s why they are pseudo religious ideologies. It’s like spiritual junk food. It’s tasty, but not nutritious.

Romanticism fails, but doesn’t go away. So, we live with decadent romanticism.

Schopenhauer (who is the godfather of nihilism) considers the irrational part of our mind that romantics consider to be imagination, will and expression, as arbitrary will. This is the will to live. It’s relentless and pointless because it’s not rational.

Kant did a copernican reversal and said the rational part of the mind is the main part and irrational is a machinery that feeds the rational. Schopenhauer does a reversal on Kant and says that it’s the irrational that’s the main part and the rational is the machinery since it’s the irrational that has the will to live.

Schopenhauer argues that you have a meaningless existence. Not in contact with reality, not even in contact with your rational ego-centric way. It’s just an irrational unconscious arbitrary will to live that is shaping filtering and framing all of your experience with the world. And then you die.

Nietzsche is the godfather of post-modernism. For Nietzsche, everything has a will to power (unlike Schopenhauer’s "everything has a will to live"). He states that this is not a feature of the mind, but a feature of reality itself. He understands the "will to power" as transcending oneself.

He understands how self-deceptive we are. But he can’t do anything about it. Reason has gone through his Kant-ian thing and reason is this logical framing thing. The problem for Nietzsche is you have self-transcendence without the machinery of dealing with self-deception. What’s the machinery for dealing with self-deception from the platonic tradition that Nietzsche rejects? That’s what rationality really is. Rationality is ultimately about the set of psycho technologies that afford self transcendence by training you skillfully overcoming self-deception.
