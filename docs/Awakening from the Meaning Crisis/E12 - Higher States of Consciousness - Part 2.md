When a person is asked to think about a problem they're stuck on (it's usually interpersonal problems), they explain it with a first person perspective. But when they are forced to explain the problem in a 3rd person perspective, they break frame. This is called de-centering.

The de-centering that happens during these experiences bring out the systematic errors the person has been committing and shed light on them. That's why these experiences are described with metaphors such as 'being asleep'. Because when you 'wake up', you'll have a systematic insight. You're seeing this because of powerful de-centering. If you're still pursuing this, think about how ill-prepared, untutored you'll be while confronting this. That's why it's important to have that individual go through a wisdom tradition in which they have a committed community that can give wise advice.

The world is revealing itself to you and you pick up those patterns and you reveal yourself to the world. That's reciprocal revelation. That's also Love.

Love is mutually accelerating disclosure. If I honestly disclose something about me and then you pick that up and disclose something about yourself. And then I do the same, and this goes on. That engenders love. Love is something you know by participating in it. It is knowing by loving.

One of the functions of your *self* (not your mind, but your self) is that you act as a glue. You recognize things that are relevant to you and then you make them relevant to each other, in other words - glue them.

The self is a set of functions for integrating things together. This integration and complexication of information can be exapted and can be projected on to the world. This can be used to achieve a deeper integration and reveal a deeper underlying pattern in the world.

All that machinery that is egocentric, like asking questions like "who am I? why am I here?" and other such thought-provoking questions that one gets and then be like "I want to forget about myself for a bit, and project this machinery on to the world". This is radical de-centering. That will be coupled with the radical sense of the being mode and the radical sense of "remembering" who and what we are.

Neural networks use disruptive strategies to make sense of the world. Statistics is basically this: do the patterns in the sample set conform with the patterns in the world.

NN try to overfit the data. They don't tend to generalize (also called data compression). Precisely because they're very powerful, they overfit. So, what can we do? Add noise in the system? Turn off half of the nodes. Basically, disrupt. This allows you to compress. And that allows you to find real invariants that will generalize across all the varying contents. At the same time, you don't want to underfit, because you won't find anything meaningful.

People who pursue higher states of consciousness use disruptive strategies coupled with pattern detection. This is what's going on at the psychological level. But what's going on at the brain level is that the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain that are responsible for intelligence keep switching between hyperactive and hypoactive states. This is also precisely what goes on during insight.

Normally your brain goes between two states: integrating and segregating. But under the influence of psilocybin, there's *metastability* wherein these states exist simultaneously.

Complexification is when you're both integrating and differentiating. You went from being a zygote to a human. A zygote, as it grew, differentiated into different cells (eye cells, heart cells, etc), and those cells also integrated to perform interdependent functions. You're complex because you're both integrating and differentiating.

Complexification gives you emergent functions. It gives you new abilities. You can do things as a person that you couldn't do as a zygote. Psilocybin helps your brain complexify and come up with emergent abilities. It allows you to see the world (massive integration) in a grain of sand (massive differentiation).

We consider something to be trustworthy if we get information from multiple channels. For example, if we're only seeing something, we probably won't trust it and think that it's an illusion. Whereas, if we see, touch, hear and smell it, we think that information we just got is very trustworthy. This lowers the probability that I'm self-deceived.

Once we have this system of model that ensures trustworthiness, we want to apply it to the world. This phenomenon is commonly called *Elegance*. A theory is considered to be elegant if it can be taken and applied to other things.

Getting information from multiple sources is called Convergence. That information being adaptive enough to be appiled to several other aspects is calld Elegance/Power/Multi-apt appilcation. There's also fluency (cognitive fluency). These are not enough to achieve insight, What we need is a balance between convergence and elegance.

If there's too much convergence and very little elegance, it leads to *triviality*. The thing about trivial statements is not that they're false, they're true. But they're not powerful. They're not transformative.

If there's very little convergence, but lot of power, things get far fetched. Conspiracy theories have this effect.

When there's deep convergence, deep elegance and high fluency, we find that proposal profound.

What we saw so far with higher states of consciousness is:

-   Convergence
    -   deautomatization
    -   decentering
    -   fluency
    -   flowing optimal grip
-   Elegance/Power
    -   nexus for development (identifying systematic errors)
    -   complexification of processing
    -   emergent new functions
    -   exaptation of insight and self machinery
