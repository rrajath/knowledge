title: E08 - Buddha and Mindfulness

Sati - means remembering what it's like to be in the being mode. It's like going to a place and thinking "this is what it was like to be me at the time". It's a modal memory. It's a participatory knowing.

Sati translates to Mindfulness. Another way of looking at it is to wake up, to remember. The word remember (re-member) means 'to belong to'.

Mindfulness in modern words gets defined incorrectly - as a feature list. It is usually defined as:

-   being present
-   non-judging
-   having insight
-   reduce reactivity (to become more balanced)

This feature list is missing the sfo. It must be turned into a feature schema.

These are meaningless and can't be explained clearly. For example, what is "being present"? What does present even mean? The nanosecond? The last 5 minutes? The last hour? And what does "here" mean? This spot? This room? This universe?

Mindfulness is usually explained as paying attention to the present moment - to the here and now. This is where the spotlight metaphor is used. But it doesn't work that way, for the reasons explained above.

Being present and non-judging are something you can do or get into. They are states that you can get into. Insight and reducing reactivity are results, or traits that you can cultivate.

The feature list doesn't talk about this. It doesn't talk about how these are casually related. It doesn't talk about how the states cause the traits.

Now, what does being present mean? It means paying the right kind of attention. It's a way to concentrate such that there's "renewed interest". When you're concentrating on something, you're constantly exploring something and trying to understand it.

Attention isn't a spotlight. It's a very complex optimization process. It's about tuning and getting between too tight and too loose (string instrument metaphor), and allowing yourself to get intimately involved with whatever you're paying attention to.

Paying attention is an optimization strategy. You pay attention by optimizing what you're doing. For example, if you're practicing chess, you're not playing chess *and* "practicing". You're basically optimizing how you play chess.
