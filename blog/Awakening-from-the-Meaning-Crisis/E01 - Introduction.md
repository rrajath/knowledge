Meaning crisis 

A few tens of thousands of years ago we started developing art - sculptures, cave paintings and even music. Then we developed projectile weapons. This is something we take for granted because there's a lot going on. For you to hit a moving target with something in your hand you have to calculate the distance it's at, the speed at which it's moving, the weight of the thing in your hand, with what force you have to throw it, *when* to throw it, etc. all of this must be done in a split second.

Humans experienced an extinction event about 70 thousand years ago because of climate change (end of last ice age, eruption of a super volcano). The way humans reacted to this was not with technological innovation, but socio cultural innovation. **They formed rituals**. They formed trade routes. This is also something that's taken for granted now. Living in a city with lot of strangers is weird and no species does that. When we meet someone we shake their hands and ask how are you, but there's a lot going on in shaking hands. We size them up, see if they have any weapons, how tense they are and such.

We go from first person perspective to a third person perspective to see how *they* think, how *they* feel. Only with this kind of perspective will we know what we're getting into if we trade with them. This enhanced perspective on others is called **mindsight** - the ability to pick up on other peoples' mental states. As you increase your ability to pick up on other peoples mental states, you'll start picking up on your own mental states - this will be the origin of things like meta cognition and mindfulness.

With trade routes, one has to interact with strangers. When they do that, their commitment to their own group will be questioned. So humans had another kind of ritual - initiation ritual. If one must join a group outside of their own tribe, the group they are joining will have initiation rituals where the individual that's joining must go through some sort of ordeal to prove loyalty. This kind of ritual would involve risk, threat and sacrifice.

Exaptation - evolutionary term where an organ built for one thing is used for something more. Example: tongue. Never designed for speech. It was mainly designed for moving food around and tasting poison. But it was exalpted to be used for speech.

A tool is something that fits your biology and enhances it. Clothes is a tool that fits your biology and enhances your body by letting you carry stuff around, protect you from cold, etc. Table is a tool that enhances your biology by being a thing that you can use to place objects on. And so on.

Psycho-technology - fits your brain and enhances it. Literacy is a psycho-technology. You're not born literate. You develop literacy that enhances your brain to perform other functions. Like networking with other brains and solving problems. Shamanism is another form of psycho-technology because shamans help you recognize patterns in the world that you would have otherwise missed, and enhance your cognitive abilities while doing so.
