title: E04 - Socrates and the quest for wisdom

I pay more attention to it, it becomes more salient. It becomes more salient, I pay more attention to it, because it's more attractive. These two things feed on each other.

Truth and relevance must be tightly coupled. Seeking one without the other does not add meaning.
