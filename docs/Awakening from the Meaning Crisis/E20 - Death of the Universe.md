Eckhart belongs to a group called Rhineland Mystics. They are deeply influenced by neoplatonism. What Eckhart says is, it’s not that loves moves the will. Love is the way in which the way will moves. Specifically, when the will negates itself, that’s love. They focus on the sacrificial aspect of love.

How is the will moving in order to be loving? The will is negating itself. For example, when my will is self-centered and is ego-centric, that’s the opposite of agape. I have to sacrifice this willful self-assertion in order to become a conduit for agape (to make a space so that god would come to dwell within me).

What’s spirituality is about is the will negating its own self-assertion and making a space in which God’s will is not in assertion. So, there’s God’s will (agapic love) and we’re resisting that. We should stop resisting. We have to negate our self-assertion (the way we’re expressing ourselves) and we have to make space so that god could flow in. What this does is, it makes self negation (inner conflict) central to spirituality.

For Occam, it’s not God’s reason, his intelligibility that gives the source of his being. For Occam, it’s his will. Because Aquinas has made His will his faculty, an access to the supernatural, the faculty of will becomes central to spirituality and God. It’s not God’s agapic love that is his creativity, it’s God’s will that is the source of his ability. God speaks the world into existence. It’s the act of *assertion*, God *asserts* the world that He created.

Your model of God has a tremendous influence on how you understand yourself and reality, regardless of whether or not you believe in God. God’s will supercedes His reason. That means God is not bound by rationality or how things cohere in a rational fashion. That means, any order that we find in existence is arbitrarily imposed upon us by God’s will. God speaks it; it’s an act of will. He’s not bound by any rational principles or organization. It’s just raw power on His part.

Occam says what we see and categorize in reality (like book, table, pen, etc) don’t really exist as we see it. We make sense of things by using language and interpret them as we see fit. So, all that exists is raw individuals and the causal relations between them. When you read things, you consume information and make sense of them with the help of language. All this exists only in your mind and not in the real world. So, in a very real sense, the world is absurd. It is not in itself inherently intelligible. It’s only intelligible insofar as I speak about it, or insofar as God speaks it into existence.

During this time, the bubonic plague happens and 1/3rd of Europe is wiped out. People think it’s the end of the world. They start to move both geographically and within social structures. They’re no longer tied rigidly to they status all their life. They decide to sell their labor for more money. They now believe that they can transform themselves purely by willpower with the chaotic backdrop of reality. And God is less and less to be a source of rational order and more and more to be a source of arbitrary power.

Commercialism and enterpreneurship is born. Banks are created, insurance company. People are putting pressure on the govt to not just work for the church and the aristocracy, but also protect contract, lay down rules, etc. People start (unintentionally) creating a secular alternative, a secular source of wealth, power and prestige. And they’re beginning to secularize the state in order to safeguard those secular endeavors. The supernatural world is largely irrelevant to these secular projects.

With commercialism, people want to a new psychotechnology. They replace Roman numerals with Hindu-Arabic numerals. This speeds up processing numbers and make calculations. There’s also algebra where values can be represented by variables. Then there’s zero an negative numbers (for representing deficit). With all this, there’s an upsurge of mathematical psychotechnology that’s available for people.

They also improve celestial navigation and find that some planets (like Mars) don’t move as they thought they did. Mars moves in retrograde. As they apply Aristotilian thinking, the new math and the new psychotechnology, they realize how chaotic the heavens actually are.

Copernicus comes along and says "The math is better if the sun is at the center".

What’s Aristotle’s way of determining if things are real?

1.  Is the relevant organ functioning properly?
2.  Is the medium not distorting the information?
3.  Do other people, after rational discussion, agree with you?

Now think about this. It’s morning, we’re all sober, we have perfect vision. We all see the sun rise in the east and set in the west. We all see the same thing, we all come to an agreement. And we’re all wrong. It’s an illusion. Now if that’s an illusion, what else isn’t an illusion?

Between your mind and the actual world, there’s a barrier that is experience. It’s not putting me in touch with the world, it’s actually a veil. Amidst all this illusion, there’s a very narrow channel of math.

Galileo comes along and says math is the only real language of the universe. Your mind cannot fathom reality through your senses, because you don’t know what’s an illusion and what’s not. But math can be used to represent abstract concepts - for example, the sides of a triangle can represent distance and time and the hypotenuse can be speed. But there’s nothing triangluar about speed. Now the triangle can represent something else in a different context. He starts to use math in an abstract symbolic way.

What comes out of all of this? Galileo kills the universe. What he discovers is inertial motion. Things don’t move because of an inner drive or a purpose. That’s a narrative way of understanding of the world. Things move because they’re hit by a random arbitrary external force and they’ll continue moving like that until another external force is applied on it.

Before Galileo, everything is alive, everything is driving to where they belong to make the universe a beautiful place. After Galileo, everything is dead. There’s no inner life to matter. Nothing’s moving on purpose, at all. Before Galileo, you were like everything else. You act on purpose and so does everything else. When Galileo kills the universe, you’re now a little island of purpose in a vast desert of purposelessness. You’re alone. You don’t belong and the universe is an indifferent motion.

Galileo starts to understand matter differently. In the old worldview, matter was the potential. But now, matter is that which resists.

Why do I want matter to be inert and resisting me? It’s actually a beneficial thing if the world is resisting me. What everybody’s telling me is, it’s all chaos and I’m deceiving myself. The only hope I have is if the world pushes back on me. If the world resists my will. Everything is defined in terms of will and the resistance to will.

Now what you have is a lifeless universe and a battle between isolated wills largely creating illusions and its vast inert will-less and resisting machinery of the universe.

Gailleo removes there being any basis for evil. Before, we had a cosmological explanation. Evil was a hole in the being, a pure potential, pure chaos. There *is* no such thing now. Matter is just inert and resistent. Which means, we now don’t have a way to talk about evil. We can’t define evil.

Galileo gives us the scientific method. The scientific method is a way for overcoming our willful generation of illusion and self-deception. The whole point of the scientific method is the resistance of the world, the inert purposeless world to resist our purposes and our will to show us how we’re deceiving ourselves. That means you’re going to give a huge priority to the scientific method and the math.

He says, anything that we can measure with math is real. The mathematical properties make things real. This is *objective*. What about the meaning? Like, how sweet something is, how beautiful a sunset is? Where does that exist? It exists in the mind and that’s *subjective*. *You* experience the *illusion* of it being in the world. The world is not meaningful, it’s not purposeful, it’s not filled with beauty, truth or goodness. The world is not filled with chairs, cups and books either. They’re not mathematical entities. They’re created by your meaning-making mind and its willful self-deception.
