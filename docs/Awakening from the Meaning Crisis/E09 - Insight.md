Do this experiment. Use a "probe" (like a pen) and with your eyes closed touch a nearby object (like a cup) by holding that probe in your hand. As you do this, you'll start to figure out that the cup probably has something of a handle, it's hollow, etc. Now shift your awareness to the probe - see how the probe hits the cup, the sound it makes, etc. Now shift your attention again to your hand and notice how you are holding the probe, the sensation in your fingers, the pressure, etc.

What's happening in this experiment is that you're knowing the cup *through* the probe. The probe is "transparent" and the cup is "opaque". An analogy here would that of glasses you wear. You see the world *through* your glasses. But once you take it off you can look *at* the glasses. The glasses were initially "transparent" because of which you were able to see through them. Once you removed them it became "opaque". This is a transparency to opacity shift.

Being aware through the probe is subsidiary/implicit awareness. Being aware of the cup is focal/explicit awareness. It's attention through subsidiary awareness into focal awareness. But you can shift that to make the subsidiary awareness to be your focal awareness.

Opacity to transparency shift is the opposite where you look at the probe through your fingers and then progress to look at the cup through your probe. These can also be seen as an in-out metaphor. You look in and out.

Literacy is another example. You don't look *at* literacy, you look *through* it.

An example of how reading works: in order to read a word you have to read each letter, but in order to disambiguate the letters you have to read the whole word, so reading is impossible. But it isn't. What's happening is, your attention is going from features (individual letters) to gestalt (the whole word) and from gestalt to features simultaneously. This can be converted into up-down metaphor.

Your attention is constantly going "in and out" and also "up and down" all the time. And the spotlight metaphor doesn't capture any of that.

There are no absolute features. For example, letters are the features of a word and words are features of a sentence.

Often as you move towards gestalt, you're getting a bigger picture and you use that to look deeper into the world. This is what we do in science too. We have a pattern like F=MA, once we have this pattern, we no longer look at individual components like force, mass and acceleration and instead use this pattern to look deeply into the world. This is called scaling up of attention.

Same goes for the opposite where as you look at the features you step back and look at the world. This is called scaling down of attention.

So how does this apply to meditation? In meditation we're usually instructed to focus on our breath, and the sensations in our body. Normally we don't look at our sensations, but instead look *through* our sensations and into the world. Meditation tries to flip this and make us look *at* our sensations. Here we're scaling down our attention. We're stepping back and looking at our mind framing things. We're breaking down the gestalt into features by noticing the sensations and experiences.

Contemplative practices are scaling up of attention. Contemplative practices and meditative practices are treated as synonyms, but they're not. Contemplate, if you look at the Latin etymology, refers to temple - looking *up* at the gods.

The 9-dot problem can be solved by transparency to opacity shift.

Scaling down can improve your chances for insight by breaking up a bad frame. But it can also mess up your problem solving by causing you to choke. Scaling up improve your ability for insight by causing you to make a better frame. But it can also cause you to leap into an inappropriate frame and be lost.

What you want to do is to get people to flow between the two states of scaling up and scaling down. So they're able to coordinate and constantly get the right degree of attention and engagement that is most dynamically fitted to the world.

Mindfulness is teaching us how to appropriate and train our flexibility of attentional scaling so that we can intervene effectively in how we're framing our problems and increase the chances of insight when insight is needed.

What happens when you continously scale down is what is called a Pure Consciousness Event. This is where you keep stepping back while meditating and you reach a point where you're just conscious. You're not even conscious of you being present. You just exist as consciousness.

If you keep scaling up (i.e. do a lot of contemplative practices), you'll develop empathetic, participatory, super flow state. You'll reach this feeling of being one with everything, which is termed as resonant at-onement. Ultimately we want these two together.

There's a 3rd state - a state of non-duality. It's both PCE and resonant at-onement both at the same time. This called Prajna, translates to wisdom. In this state you're going to have an insight into the guts and the fundamentals of the agent arena combination. You can have fundamental insight into the Existential modes. This is how you can *remember* the being mode.

Sati - is the fundamental insight into what it's like to be a human being.
