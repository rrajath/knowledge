**Prosoche** - pay attention to how you're paying attention. That is, learn to see the meaning (existential meaning) and the event. This is learning to distinguish between the event and the meaning you give to the event. Due to our framing of things, events and their meaning are fused together. But they're not identical. Events are events and their meaning is the co-identification process that's taking place in response to the event. The meaning isn't part of the event at all.

If the meaning and the event are fused, the only way you can alter the meaning is by altering the event. We are con-fused.

You have way more control over the meaning than you realize and practice, and have way less control over the event than you realize and practice.

**Procheiron** - this means practice. It means remembering, like mindfulness - remembering in a way that brings skills, sensitivities and sensibilities to bear in an appropriate and effective manner. It means remembering in a modally existential sense.

It's not mortality that we are worried about, it's fatality. Fatality doesn't mean death. The root of this word is Fate. When we fuse meaning and event together, we become subject to the fatality of all things. Everything is fatal in that the meaning and the thing are not identical and if you forget that, you will suffer when they come apart.

Why is Fatality associated with death? Because death is where meaning and event come apart. Death is where the events of the universe, and all of your meaning and all of your identity become radically undone. Death is "fatal" and it reveals to you the ultimate loss of agency that meaning and event are not identical.

One of the things both Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus talk about is the socratic line of questioning with yourself. This is different from ruminating. When you're ruminating, you'd say something like "Everything I do is your failure". When you say this to yourself, you get yourself into a loop where you start bullshitting yourself. Spending a little more time and some socratic questioning you'd soon realize that not *everything* you do is a failure. Most things are okay. You'll also start what "everything" is about (ones which are more salient to you than others), what "failure" means to you and what "meaning" means to you.

When you stop and invoke your internal Socrates when you think about things like "everything I do is a failure", you'd question yourself the way Socrates would've done it. For example, "wow, so you're making such powerful claims; you must know and understand". When you don't do this, you're bullshitting yourself. The "Everything" is so salient to you but it's way beyond your understanding. It's not representing what you actually mean. This maybe what you believe, but can't be what you mean. You're bulshitting yourself because your motivation and your arousal is way ahead of your understanding. Because of that, the meaning and the event are con-fused together.

If you can discern, not just in thought, but in perspective and identity, the meaning and the event and properly identify your sense of control, then you'll alter your sense of identity.

How does this relate to death/mortality? Imagine you're immortal, you'd go about doing everything you pleased, then go about learning everything you could and then you'd get bored. The problem was not about the longevity of your life, but instead it's to do with the depth.

Imagine a cartesian graph with X axis representing the Having Mode and the Y axis representing the being Being Mode. This extends in both positive and negative directions along both axes. Where would you place yourself, or strive to be on the graph? If you place yourself on the Y axis of the Being Mode, the fullness of being, and even if it lasts a moment, that's enough. It's not based on the duration, not based on quality.

**Kairos** - perspectival participatory knowing. It's about timing. For example, you're not in a romantic relationship with Susan, but you kiss her. If you get the timing right, or if the kairos is right, the course of the relationship is altered. Your identity and her identity change.

The Israelite conception was for the whole nation and God would intervene kairotically at moments in history. Their notion was that God "speaks" in 'logos' via 'kairos' and that Jesus is the ultimate Kairos, that all the kairos is pointing to him and is summed up in him. Because he's a person, you can identify with him and that kairos can come and take place in you, personally.

**Metanoia** - radical transformation. Often translated as conversion. "noia" means noticing - perspectival awareness, "meta" means beyond. This means a radical transformation in your salience landscape. A radical transformation of what it's like to be you. This is a deeply perspectival and participatory transformation. And Jesus says that he incarnates the principle by which an intervention can occur in your own personal history such that this "metanoia", you will have a new mind, a new heart, a new modal existence. You'll be born again.

What can bring this transformation? Love. The problem is that the word Love is trivialized. For example, you'd say things like, I love peanut butter, I love a really good game of tennis, etc. Love is **not** a feeling or an emotion. Love is a modal way of being. It is an agent-arena relationship.

What Jesus seemed to be incarnating as a kairos to change the history of the world and to offer you to change your own personal history is a different kind of love - Agape.

There 3 kinds of love - eros, philia and agape.

-   **Eros** - is the kind of love that seeks to be one with something. It could be spiritual, like being one with the world, or even a cookie by eating it. We come to think of eros erotically by being one with somebody by having sex with them.
-   **Philia** - is the love of consummation. It is the love that seeks co-operation/reciprocity. We love our friends because we're in reciprocity with them.
-   **Agape** - is the love a parent has for their child. You're not consuming it, or becoming one with it. By loving it, you're turning a non-person into a person. You've become an agape because people loved you before you were a person, so you've become the person that you are. Love turns non-persons (animals) into moral agent persons. It is powerful

Here's what Jesus was offering, that love can be exapted and made availabe for all. Here's why Christianity will take the Roman Empire, culturally. With Agape, Christianity can say, all the non-persons in the Roman Empire, all the women, children, all the non-male citizens, all the sick, all the poor, the widowed, all of them are taken and said "we will turn you into persons, that belong in the kingdom of God".
