title: E10 - Consciousness

One of the accounts for consciousness is Global Workspace Theory. The idea is that consciousness works like a desktop on your computer. You have a bunch of files. You bring one or more of them on to the desktop, transform them and broadcast it back. Similarly, you have some unconscious thoughts that you bring to the foreground, they interact with each other. Then broadcast it back. This architecture is trying to solve the Frame Problem.

There's overwhelming amount of information outside of us (in our environment) that comes through our sensory inputs. There's overwhelming amount of information that's in our memory. The number of ways these can be combined is astronomical. So, what consciousness is trying to do is to get relevant information outside and inside, and combine them in a way that's relevant to us. The core function of consciousness is to realize relevant information.

Another account of consciousness is the Integrated Information theory. It's about how different pieces of Integrated information in your brain is interacting and causally affecting other pieces of information in your brain. This theory deals with the nature of consciousness rather than the function (GWT). This theory proposes that the Integrated Information helps you make things relevant to you.

Your consciousness cannot take in all the information available outside of you. So it creates a salience landscape. What this means is, it picks up certain features (Featurization), foregrounds some of those features (Foregrounding), then you "figure out" the features (Figuration). And from what you've figured, you're framing problems. Think about these as features and gestalt that go in an out and everything is related to each other.

What's happening here is, you're using your salience landscape to get an optimal grip on things. If you're trying to look at a cup, you can't go too close because you'll lose the features. You can't go too far because you won't be able to get the details on the cup. So you move around to get to the right distance to view the cup optimally.

The grip here is a metaphor. With consciousness doing all this, an affordance opens up. An affordance is where the constraints of the cup and the constraints of your hand work well together. And you realize that the cup is graspable. It's not the property of the cup because a dog can't grasp it. It's not the property of your hand because it cannot grasp everything. It's where the constraints work together. So, in a way, you're not seeing colors and shapes. You're seeing affordances. You find that the floor is walkable, a chair is where you can sit, a table is where you can place things, and so on.

This is also where the agent-arena combination comes into play. I'm a grasper and the cup is graspable. I'm presenting myself to the cup and the cup is presenting itself to me.

Consciousness creates a salience landscape where you are sizing up or figuring out optimal grip. This creates a presence landscape that has affordances. Your brain is figuring out correlational patterns from causal patterns and this creates a depth landscape.

Altered states of consciousness is not an insight *in* consciousness. It's a insight *of* consciousness. What if you have a systematic insight where you're changing the salience landscaping instead of how you frame the problem? That's to be wise.

When you have salience systematically tracking presence in depth so that you can wisely zero in on what is relevant to you and makes your life meaningful, you'll get a significance landscape. It protects you from bullshitting, allows you to see through illusion and into reality and it affords you to have a comprehensive flowing relationship with reality.

Higher states of consciousness create transformative experiences where you feel that state is more real than your everyday reality. But this can also be destructive, instead of being transformative. Why/how do you know that the dreams aren't real? Because the dream world isn't coherent with the real world. So you end up rejecting the dream world when you wake up because as real as it seems while you're dreaming, it no longer coheres with the real world. But sometimes the higher states of consciousness could make you feel like that world is more real even though it was incoherent compared to the real world. So much so that you reject the real world. It does this without providing any new content. These experiences usually can't be put into words, you can't explain or justify.

We need a descriptive account and a prescriptive account for these higher states of consciousness. A descriptive account that gives us the underlying cognitive processes, machine learning, information processing which help us in understanding why the cognitive processes are the way they are. The prescriptive account should show us how these processes actually provide the rational justification for the transformation that the people undertake.

People who have transformative experiences are not gaining knowledge, they're gaining wisdom. They're gaining skills and sensibilities and sensitivities of the significance landscape that radically transform your Existential Mode.
