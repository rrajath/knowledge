title: E11 - Higher States of Consciousness - Part 1
---

We want to look at 3 components while discussing higher states of consciousness: how's the world being experienced, how's the self being experienced, and how's the relationship between the two.

If you look at how the world is being experienced, you'd see that it is perceived as very coherent and that it seems to make a lot of sense. People who experience higher states of consciousness tend to see both the expansive view of the world where they understand the infinite and they also happen to see the minute details. The world looks beautiful. All this comes together as oneness.

What's happening to the self? A profound sense of peace is experienced. They also experience a profound joy. People enter flow state, They feel a deep connection with the world. So much that they're participating with the world.

These states are often preceeded by disruptive strategies. Long term disruptive strategies include years of meditation and coming out with enhanced insight. Short term strategies include sleep and sex deprivation, chanting, drumming, psychedelics. These will disrupt your normal functioning of your consciousness.

When people explain these experiences, you observe decentering. People are much less egocentric and more allocentric. They go from first person to third person.

There is experimental evidence where if you show a scene that people can understand and make sense and then ask them to rate their lives, they tend to rate it higher. This means, just the act of making sense elevates thier sense of how meaningful their lives are.

If information is made easier to process, then we consider that piece of information to be more trustworthy, even though they are factually the same. An example would be, reading the same text in two different fonts where one is clearer than the other. This is fluency. Insight is a fluency spike. So the idea here is, when you're fluent, you're processing information more efficiently.

When you're in a higher state of consciousness, your fluency increases. So, the information you're processing is judged as something that's real. In real world situations, if you're processing information very fluently, then you're picking up on real patterns.

Insight is zeroing in. Flow is insight cascade, which is even more zeroing in. It is coupled with implicit learning where you're picking up on real patterns that you're not consciously aware of. This is all being triggered in the higher states of consciousness.

Why are we doing this? Because we want a legitimate, scientifically plausible explanation of what's going on when somebody claims enlightenment (like Buddha), or when somebody claims radical self transformation (like Plato).

**Continuity Hypothesis**: fluency -> insight -> flow experience -> mystical experiences -> transformative experiences. The more you can prime this pump, the more you can bring about these enhanced experiences or enhanced anagoge.

We know that flow state needs relevant expertise. If you don't have the expertise, you'll not get into the flow state. So what's flowing in HSC? What process is being optimized? - Optimal Grip.

What's optimal grip? When we try to preceive an object, we're not static. We move around in such a way that we can optimally observe the object in both its overall structure as well as the finer details.

We default to the basic level. For example, we categorize things like cat and dog. When we see a dog, we say it's a dog. We don't go up one level and say it's a mammal. We also generally don't go down a level and say it's a poodle. We "default" to this "basic level". Why do we default to the basic level? It's because that's how we get an optimal grip. We don't want to get too abstract and don't want to get too generic.

You always have optimal grip in all domains. Like talking to someone. What if the reason you want to get into flow state was to optimally grip the world? It wouldn't be on a particular object. It would be a dynamical flowing optimal grip on the world and yourself.

What's happening in HSC is that people are flowing in their capacity to cognitively and perceptually get an optimal grip on both the world and themselves and that's why the relation is experienced as so intensely powerful and so intensely revealing.

**Deautomatization**: breaking of automatic framing. Like the 9-dot problem, you automatically assumed that it's a connect the dot problem and that prevented you from solving the problem.

What these disruptive strategies do is they increase variation, often by introducing noise, entropy into your processing. You're increasing your variation on what you're paying attention to. Increasing variation is good since it makes you aware of what's invariant (or not changing). For example, when I move around an object, lot's of stuff could change around it, but the shape stays the same and I perceive the object as real.

There's good invariance and bad invariance. With good invariance, you pick up more complex patterns. Bad invariance are ways in which you're framing your problems that are preventing you from solving them.

You don't make one error. Instead, you make a system of errors. Like, a child that chooses a set of 5 candies that are spaced far apart than the set that are placed closer together. When they have the systematic insight and massively intervene on themselves, then they go through a developmental change and they grow up and they mature. That's what could be going on in the enlightenment experience - an adult is to a child what a sage is to an adult.
