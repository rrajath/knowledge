title: Aristotle's world view and Eric Fromm
---

Rationality, at least in the axial age, meant realization of your self-deceptions and then having the capacity to self-correct. The core motivation of rationality is a desire to come into as deep a contact with reality as possible by those means that are as reliable as possible.

Someone who describes a chair doesn't do as good a job of describing it as someone who made the chair. Aristotle's view of "knowing a chair" is when one actualizes the chair in their mind. This means, they change themselves to con-form to the chair and thereby "know" the chair. This is called the conformity theory.

Participatory knowing is when I shape myself in order to know a thing and I know myself by conforming to it. Descriptive knowing is when one is at a distance from an object, like a chair, and describes it.

Participatory knowing is important to be in contact with reality and plays a huge role in generating meaning *because* it makes us be more in contact with reality. Once we've made sense of things, and their sfo, the pattern in our mind is the same as the pattern in the world.

An example of conforming with reality: Tom likes Susan and his friend tells him that she likes him as well and heard her say it at a party they were in the previous night. Tom doesn't believe it because he saw his friend be really drunk and that the party was noisy. But Tom says he heard it before he got drunk, in the kitchen where it wasn't noisy and other friends heard it too. So, you do these 3 tests: mind functioning optimally, environment functioning without any distortions, confirm inter-subjective experiences. This will confirm that what's in your mind aligns with what's in the real world.

Aristotle had geocentric world view. His conformity theory and the geocentric world view mutually supported each other, because the patterns in your mind conformed with what was in reality. That's how you get a world view - you have an account of the world and you have an account of how you know the world that mutually support each other in very strong bonds of plausibility.

An arena is a place that is organized such that you know how you can act in it. It makes sense to you, you know where things belong, what actions are appropriate, how you can calibrate. You can conform to that situation very powerfully.

To be an agent is to be capable of pursuing your goals. To organize your cognition and your behavior so that your actions fit the situation.

What happens when you have a world view is that there's an agent and arena coupling. Aristotle tells you how to become an agent through conformity theory. And he's telling you how the world is organized. This leads to co-identification. The identity of the arena is determined by and determines the identity of the agent, and vice versa.

For example, a football player (agent) goes to a football field (arena). The arena allows them to be a football player. And to a football player, it makes sense as to why the arena is structured the way it is. They co-identify each other.

Existential Mode is where you're constantly assuming the role of an agent and everything around you becomes an arena. And you're co-identifying, and you get a coherent and functioning world view.

Unless the coupling between agent and arena works, individual actions and projects of meaning don't work. This is meta-meaning. Because this mode makes possible an entire system of meanings.

The agent-arena combination, how it generates world view and the co-identification - this process is called world view attunement. If you don't have this, it'll be like a tennis player playing tennis in a football field. It wouldn't make sense to you. You'll start to experience your existence as absurd.

Buddha: There are 2 kinds of needs: having needs and being needs.

Having needs are needs that are met by having something. Having needs are categorical. For example, a cup can be categorized, it can be replaced when one gets damaged, I can control it, I have very specific use from it - drinking water. The objects in the "having needs" category have an I-it relationship. "It" is for things that have a category. What I need here is my intelligence and use it for problem solving.

Being needs are not met by having something. Being needs are met by becoming something. For example, becoming mature or virtuous. So you're not relating to things categorically. You're relating to them expressively. This deals with reciprocal realization. Example, being in love. We have an I-thou relationship. I'm not trying to solve problems. I'm instead using reason to make meaning.

Modal confusion is when being needs are met by having mode. Buying more cars won't make you more mature.

The palace is a mythological representation of Existential modes. Siddhartha leaving the palace teaches us something about overcoming modal confusion.
