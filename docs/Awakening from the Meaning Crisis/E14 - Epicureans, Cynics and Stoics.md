Polis - is not a city, but a city state. It's where the word cosmopolitan comes from. Everybody around you speaks your language, have the same religiion. Polis isn't just where you live, it's a tight relationship between agent and arena. One of the worst punishments couple thousand years ago, if you're living in Polis, is to be ostracized. Alexander the Great comes and destroys all this. People are moved from ancient Greece all the way to Asia Minor. This makes people live with those with completely different idealogies, religion, language, etc. All the deep connection is lost. People experienced Domicide - destruction of home (two types - physical and cultural)

Syncretism - merging of gods from different cultures. This starts to happen when people were displaced.

> Call no man a philosopher that doesn't alleviate the suffering of others - Epicurus

Philosophy becomes therapeutic. A new metaphor emerges. A philosopher is someone who can cure you of existential suffering.

The epicureans diagnosed that our main problem is Fear.

We use the words Fear and Anxiety interchangeably. Fear is when you have an observable direct threat. I know what to do about it. I may fail doing it, but I know what to do. Anxiety is when the threat is nebulous. You're not sure what the threat is, and you're not sure what to do.

The way we should understand epicureans is that, we are suffering because we're unable to manage our anxiety. They're not really talking about Fear (direct observable threat), but instead talking about anxiety.

According to Epicureans, we don't control our thoughts and imagination due to which we cannot manage our suffering and so we're unable to get a grip on the world.

Most people feel anxious when they think about death. One strategy to deal with this is to assume immortality. Several religions do this, but the evidence is that when you die, you're dead. You don't exist. So pursuing immortality doesn't workout. Another strategy is to radically accept mortality.

Epicureans don't think about maximizing pleasure. This is a common misconception. They say, pay attention to those things that actually give meaning. They thought the way to obtain meaning is through friendship, or meaningful relationships. Epicurus was a non-theist. He considered gods to be irrelevant.

Socrates is turned into a systematic set of psychotechnologies that you internalize into metacognition.

Cynics has a different meaning than what exists today. They had this idea that what causes us to suffer is what we set our heart on. The reason is, we can set our hearts on the wrong things and they can fail us causing us to suffer. Cynics had this view that whatever we take for granted, things that are part of the fundamental structure of reality are not actually real. They are actually man-made. They are temporary. When we set our hearts on these things, and these are taken from us, we suffer. So we should learn to set our hearts on things that are not man-made. How do we do this? By living in natural law, not man-made law. Diogenes, the cynic, does this by living like an animal. Man-made political and cultural value systems will eventually end. So, when we depend on them, at some point our hearts will be broken. Hence, you want to live in accordance with nature because those are not man-made and those will not disappear. Cynics also said, along with natural law there are moral laws - the proper way to be a human being.

Guilt vs shame. Guilt is when you do something immoral (not living up to your own standards). Shame is when you violate purity code (not living up to societal standards).

Purity codes are designed to keep the categorical boundaries that make a culture in a particular historical period running the way it's supposed to be running. They're highly tied up in the investive power structures who are usually highly invested in keeping things running the way they're running.

An example of purity code: you drink water from a glass, you swallow it. Everything's fine. If you instead spit gobs and gobs of saliva into the glass, swirled it around and then took a sip, it would look extremely uncomfortable and disgusting. Here's the purity code and it says, the body is the boundary and anything that's inside the body shouldn't come out - saliva, puke, burp, fart, etc.

Very often we confuse purity codes with moral codes. This is because we confuse our disgust reaction that are often purity code based with a moral judgment that should be based on reasoning and evidence.

Every time we persecuted gay people is because we confused purity code disgust reaction with a legitimate moral argument. What Diogenes was trying to do was to pull apart the moral code from the purity code. He did nothing immoral by masturbating in the marketplace. However, lot of people were doing something culturally acceptable in the marketplace (example, stealing), most of that was immoral. Alexander the Great comes to Diogenes and offers power and fame. But cynics say no to these things because power and fame are human-defined and your heart will eventually be broken. Set your heart on what won't get broken.

The cynics developed a very powerful provocative way of enacting Socrates and were trying to get us to realize what we're setting our heart on and to pull apart our automatic disgust reaction from moral reflection on what we're doing.

Zeno liked Plato (for his argumentative approach of enacting Socrates) and also the Cynics (for their confrontational approach of enacting Socrates). He realized that the Cynics were focusing too much on the product and not enough on the process. Too much on what we're attaching our heart to, rather than the process of the attachment itself.

Stoics said, particular cultural, political and historical traditions are variable, but human beings are social. It's part of our humanity to be social. It's not the product we set our heart on that's the problem, it's the process of *how* we set our heart on.

So, what is the process? It's the process of co-identification, the agent-arena relationship. It's the process of assuming an identity and assigning an identity. That process of co-identification where your identity is being formed, that's where your agency is taking shape. We should do it in such a way that we strengthen our agency in the face of the threat of domicide.
