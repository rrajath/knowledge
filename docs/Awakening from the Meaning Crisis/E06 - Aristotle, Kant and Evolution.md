title: Aristotle, Kant and Evolution
---

Aristotle views change as an analogy for development or growth, not just changing from one thing to another. For example, you use wood to make a chair, a table or a ship. Aristotle asked what is it that is in wood that can change it into a chair, a table or a ship and it's the sfo. He coins the term potential and says wood had the potential to be a chair, a table or a ship. This when applied to living things, it leads to a chair making itself.

Kant wondered why Newton's theory of cause and effect was so successful. He finally figured out that it doesn't create a vacuous/circular explanation. This is where you explain something using the thing itself so it goes into an infinite recursion. Whereas newton's theory clearly delineates between cause and effect.

So Kant looked at a tree and tried to see the cause and effect, and found that he ended up in a circular explanation - tree makes leaves using sunlight, and then leaves makes tree. He concluded that living things have circular explanation.

The thing with living beings is that they have a feedback cycle. An output from a system is fed back into the system making it cause a circular explanation. This created a huge gap between biology and physics.

To solve this, we have to think about the following. There are causes and constraints. Causes are events that make things happen. Constraints are conditions that make things possible. Newtonian model only focused on causes and that's incorrect. Aristotle model looked at constraints/conditions which is what gives form or sfo. For an object to be moved by an external force, the sfo of that object is necessary to make that happen. So, Newton model deals with actuality and Aristotle model deals with potentiality.

What's happening here is, events cause form (or sfo) and the form creates constraints on the events. For example, as a human being there are some events happening in the body which changes the body in a certain way. This creates constraints in the body where events happening outside the body with high probability will have a low probability of happening inside the body and vice versa.

There are two types of constraints: enabling and selective. Enabling constraints increase the probability of an event happening. Selective constraints decrease the probability of an event happening.

Applying the constraints to darwinian theory of evolution, selective constraints are things like scarcity of food. It reduces options. Enabling constraints are variation in species. They constantly act on the species causing them to increase in number due to enabling constraints and then decrease in number due to selective constraints. This is how organisms adaptand grow.

Selective constraints is like a virtual governor and enabling constraints is like a virtual generator. Add them to a feedback cycle and you get a virtual engine. Dynamic systems theory shows the relationship between governor, generator and the feedback cycle that work together to promote growth and development of the system.

Personality is what you're born with and character is something you cultivate either explicitly or implicitly. When we say somebody is acting out of character we make a moral criticism because their virtue (honesty for example) driven by the virtual engine is no longer meeting expectations. There's a deep form of foolishness that comes from lack of character. It's called Akrasia which loosely translates to weakness in the will. Meaning, you're supposed to do the right thing, but you don't.

Here's a hierarchy to cultivate character and humans have the unique ability to achieve it because they are both self-organizing and self-making. The hierarchy goes like this: inorganic matter -> living thing (example, plant) -> self-moving thing (example, animal) -> mental thing -> rational thing. To live up to your potential is to cultivate your character as high up as this hierarchy as you can go.

What are those characteristics that are unique to us? Aristotle says, your capacity for overcoming self-deception, cultivating your character, for realizing wisdom, and enhancing the structure of your psyche and the contact with reality. That's what rational means. Your purpose is to become as fully human as possible.
