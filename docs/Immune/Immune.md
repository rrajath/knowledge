**Note**: These are only partial notes. May be from about the first 30% of the book. Got tired of making so much notes since the entire book is filled with useful information.

-   Our bodies have two types of immune system:
    -   innate immune system: we're born with it. Helps fight generic class of bacteria and other germs. First thing to get activated. Then invokes adaptive immune system if needed.
    -   adaptive immune system: we adapt to it and it's used for something specific - like a specific type of pathogen.
-   skin cells start 1mm deep. These cells are basically born to die. They keep getting pushed upward and what you see as skin is just a bunch of dead skin cells.
-   Bacteria sits on your skin everywhere, and billions of them. The biggest benefit of them hanging out is that they take up space and work in symbiosis with the skin. So other bacteria and pathogen don't end up on your skin. The bacteria on your skin also communicates with the underlying skin cells and regulates how much toxins they should produce.
-   Macrophages are giant cells that eat other dead cells and bacteria that enter the body.
-   neutrophils go into a killing frenzy when athey're they're activated and start eating hundreds of cells. These are usually activated when cells send out signals when they die.
-   Whenever there's danger or damage to the body (like infection or injury), whether it's perceived or real there's inflammation. The purpose is to ensure the infection doesn't spread outside of the site of infection.
-   Inflammation has 5 markers:
    -   redness: blood rushes to the site of infection
    -   heat: site of infection becomes hot because of the body heat brought by blood. This is detrimental to bacteria's survival. But helps body cells thrive and heal faster
    -   swelling: prevents infection from spreading
    -   pain: nerve endings near inflammation are more susceptible to pain. Sends signal to brain and you feel unpleasant
    -   loss of function: you can use your burnt hand or injured foot for sometime which forces you to spend time recovering.
-   cells contain proteins which contain information called cytokines. They're neatly packaged, so when a cell is dying via controlled suicide, these are released which get gobbled up by Macrophages. But when it dies a violent death, the cytokines spill out.
-   Other cells in the body have receptors all along the cell wall. Once they "smell" cytokines they move towards it. The more cytokines their "noses" pick up, the faster they move towards the site.
-   Proteins fold on themselves and turn into different 3D shapes. These combine with other folded protein and some combinations just fit together perfectly. When this happens new life or features emerge.
-   Some organisms, bacteria for example, also contain proteins. There are some they can't live without. Just like how you can modify a car a lot but you still need wheels. Bacteria needs flagellum to propel itself forward. Cells, like Macrophages, have repectors in the cell wall and when they encounter flagella, they fit perfectly and it so happens that the cell knows (through millions of years of evolution) it's a foreign body that it must swallow. This is how innate cells can recognize bacteria (via most common puzzle piece combination) even though it never encountered a specific species.
-   bacteria sweat out proteins and they can't help it and give their identity away. Our immune system has existed alongside bacteria for millions of years and has learned to recognize these protiens.
-   Dendritic cells enter the battlefield and their function is to sample fluids. They ingest fluid with the intention to identify what category of bacteria or viruses or pathogens it's dealing with. It samples bacteria in the battlefield and goes back to report that info back to the adaptive immune system.
-   Spleen is kind of like a large lymph node. It contains about a cup of reserve blood for emergency purposes. It also filters and recycles 90% of your old blood cells. It is home for monocytes.
-   monocytes are cells that are used for reinforcement during a battle where they turn into Macrophages or dendritic cells. Half of them are patrolling in your body and turn into Macrophages when needed. If they all die and your body needs reinforcement then the Spleen sends the other half of the monocytes to the site of infection.
-   our immune cells have toll-like receptors on their outside where they can fit bacteria like puzzle pieces. But this is limiting and it can only fit certain bacteria. Nothing more. Nothing less.
-   An antigen is a piece of an enemy an immune system can recognize.
-   Your body uses gene fragments (not even whole genes) that mix and match to produce billions of different combinations that can recognize antigens. This way your body is equipped to handle potentially any antigen it encounters.
-   T-cells are those that attack antigens by connecting to them using their receptors that exist on the outer edge of their cell membrane. Thymus is an organ that is responsible for producing and training T-cells. They shouldn't be able to recognize themselves. If they did, they're killed.
