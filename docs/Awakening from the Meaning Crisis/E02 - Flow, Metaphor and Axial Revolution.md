Intuition is the result of implicit learning. When you think you deduced something intuitively, that's because you implicitly learned and picked up patterns. For example, you implicitly know how far away you have to stand when you talk to someone, and how loud you want to sound. This is not taught to you, this is not something you thought deeply about when you were growing up. You just picked up on patterns.

Opposite of intuition is bias and prejudice. This is when intuition (that is, implicitly picking up complex patterns) leads to negative outcomes. A bigot has intuition about races that are wrong. How does intuition go wrong. Implicit learning depends on complex patterns in the environment.

There are 2 kinds of patterns - correlation and causation. There's a correlation between big weddings and longer marriages. The reason for this is that bigger weddings have greater social network and better financial support which tends to make marriages last longer. However, they don't *cause* the marriage to last long.

The bigot has picked up correlation patterns instead of causal patterns. What you have to do is to train yourself to pick up causal patterns that are real instead of correlation patterns that are illusory.

You can't force implicit learning to pick up on patterns. That never works. People perform poorly when you ask them to explicitly look for patterns. So, how do you develop better implicit learning? By having better explicit training by setting up contexts where these can be learned. Science is a way of distinguishing correlation patterns from causal patterns. By doing scientific experiments one can differentiate between these patterns which would cause them to update their implicit learning and thereby their intuition.

If one wants to develop better (or good) intuition, they must be put into learning situations with contexts that have 3 things:

-   Clear information
-   tight coupling between them and the environment
-   error really matters

These are the same 3 things that work well for scientific experiments.

Flow state is making them insightful and it's also making them generators of metaphor. For example, making inscriptions on a bone can track the moon, or carving this figurine can connect me to the idea of fertility. There's a deep connection between how insightful and how good a problem solver you are and your capacity for metaphorical thought. Shamans are using psycho technology to get in to the flow state to generate metaphor.
