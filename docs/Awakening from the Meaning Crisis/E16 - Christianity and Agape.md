Agape is the kind of love that creates persons. The main metaphor for agape is the way a parent loves a child. You love it because, by loving it, you turn it from being a non-person into a person.

That radical transformative power of Agape brings about a **metanoia**. With metanoia, I'm having a personal **kairos**. And Jesus is not just teaching it, he's exemplifying it. Jesus is experiencing a kairos and he is giving people through Agape the opportunity for them to experience their own personal kairos.

What happens in this experience is a fundamental re-orientation. For a very long time, we're the receivers of Agape. We're animals before we become human beings. So, we internalize other people and how they're aware of you and that is how you gain your reflective rationality. You fundamentally gain your self-understanding, your sense of self, and your ability to reflect on yourself by how you are reflected through other people. It's as if other people are mirrors that you come to see yourself, that your sense of self, the ability to reflect on yourself. There's nothing more transformative for an adult than having a child.

From a child's perspective, it receives love from the parent. This is egocentric. From an adult's perspective, it's the opposite. The parent, for the longest time was used to love (the Eros kind) until they had a child. They were "consuming" it. What happens is, they are no longer the center of their salience landscape. Their child is.

This is metanoia. It's a transformation from being egocentric to being centered on someone else. What I'm actually centered on is the process of creating a person, like God. But not ego-centrically, but I'm participating in that agapic process that made me. The agape that preceeds me flows through me and transforms me. What Jesus was offering a teaching so that all people could experience this, not individually and personally with their parents, but in terms of a relationship to God.

What the Christian community understood is that this capacity for radically transforming people so that they become conduits of this Godlike creative process whereby turning a non-person into a person; they're coming to understand Agape itself is God.

Agape has a sacrificial component to it because, with Agape I'm giving up, I'm making myself an affordance for *your* transformation from a non-person to person. This is why Jesus emphasizes forgiveness.

When asked how to obtain forgiveness from God, Jesus' message was "to forgive other people". We experience Agape from God to the degree to which we give it to others.

The core idea of forgiveness is not where somebody feels sorry and you say it's okay. It doesn't depend on your contrition (the state of feeling remorseful). Agapic love is the giving of love *before* the receiver has "earned it". This already is forgiveness. Because you're fore-giving love. We are sacrificially extending the capacity for individuals to redirect their own history, experience their own kairos - this is expressed as being born again.

The followers of Jesus were not called "the followers of Jesus". They were called the followers of "the way".

We all are at war with Agape itself. We have a tough time acknowledging the reality of Agape. We all like to create personal fables of how we're self-made, self-directed, self-secure and self-sustaining, and Agape challenges all of that.

Paul says that God is perfectly just and we *will* fail to meet that standard. So legally, we are condemned to death. But God isn't just a judge, God is also an Agapic parent that loves us. Paul gives into this idea that Jesus sacrificed himself in order to satisfy God's demand for justice so that God was capable of truly loving us.

The gifts Christianity has given us - expectations of love and transformation, and growth into personhood, and the relief from inner conflict.
