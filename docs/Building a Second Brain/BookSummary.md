## What is a Second Brain?

-   having a second brain helps our primary (or physical) to take much less cognitive load since it doesn't have to hold too many things in its working memory. Everything that's not needed at the present moment for the task at hand can be off-loaded to second brain.
-   Knowledge building block is discrete unit of information that stands on its own. But a bunch of them can be combined to form articles, blog posts, reports, books, papers, etc.
-   Too often when we take on a task, we tend to favor using resources we came across only recently. Having a second brain gives us to ability to search through a vast archive and find things that help us with the task.


## The 4 aspects of building a second brain

CODE: Capture, Organize, Distill, Express


### Capture: keep what resonates

Don't highlight everything. Highlight with a purpose in mind. Criteria:

-   Does it inspire me?
-   Is it useful?
-   Is it personal?
-   Is it surprising?

### Organize: save for actionability

Ask yourself, how will this help me move forward one of my current projects.

#### The PARA Method

Everything you capture can be organized into one for the 4 categories

-   **Projects**: have definite start and end dates, success/completion criteria.
-   **Areas**: these are ongoing, like health, finance, career, relationships, etc.
-   **Resources**: these are not related to current project, but you sense that it will be useful in a future project.
-   **Archive**: everything that's completed/canceled will end up here. So, nothing is lost.

### Distill: find the essence

Ask yourself every time you make a note, "how can I make this as useful as possible for my future self"

-   Make sure that the notes you take are disvoverable. Every time you interact with a note you gotta leave it a little better and increase their discoverability. This can be done by progressively summarizing, adding tags, moving them to the right folder, etc.
-   **Progressive summarization**: for any note that is captured, the summarization can take on many layers - captured notes -> bolded passages -> highlighted passages -> executive summary

### Express: show your work

Apply what you saved in previous steps into a blog post, article, book, or current project, etc. **Intermediate packets (IP)** are concrete individual blocks that make up your work. These can be anything - meeting notes, action items, etc. Any note can be potentially used as an IP in some larger project. It's basically breaking down a project into multiple smaller chunks so that one/many such IPs can be plugged and played in a larger project. They have the following benefits:

1.  You become interruption-proof since you're working on a much smaller sub-task
2.  You'll be able to make progress in any span of time. Instead of waiting for a large chunk of time to focus on your project, you can use a smaller chunk of time when available and complete the IP.
3.  You can get feedback more often as you send these smaller chunks for review
4.  You'll have so many IPs at your disposal that you can essentially combine a bunch of them and execute an entire project.

**IP retrieval methods**: search, browsing, tags, serendipity (keep search broad and look at neighboring notes, related terms, etc.)

IP isn't about just breaking down a project into smaller chunks. It's about making each individual chunk more discoverable and shareable and potentially collaborative.

## Divergence and convergence

Whenever we work on a project we're either in Divergence mode or convergence mode. Divergence is where we're in an exploratory phase where we broaden our search and explore. Convergence is where we pick on and go deep.

## How to make better notes?

Three ways:

1.  **Archipelago of Ideas**: put related ideas together. Once you're in convergence mode, it'll be easier to find them and create something
2.  **Hemmingway bridge**: end each note with some pointers for the next time you visit that note. Something like the current status, next steps, action items, etc.
3.  **Reduce scope and deliver**: things can get overwhelming when trying to work on a big project. It's better to reframe the project as "what's the smallest and most important part of the project I can deliver quickly?"
