Martin Luther is deeply influenced with the Rhineland Mystics. He’s an Augustinian monk. Deeply influenced by Augustine’s ideologies. Also, Paul’s ideas.

Self-negation in Luther’s psyche has become self-loathing. He experiences the self as radically folded into itself, obsessed with itself in a completely immorally self-centered fashion. As the self is being folded and obsessed with itself, it’s being cut off from God and cut off from reality. So, it’s very much a *self*-destructive process.

We keep repeating the self-destructing patterns.

Augustine has a different interpretation of Paul which puts him at odds with the Catholic church. This is the interpretation that you’re saved by faith alone where faith becomes nothing more than a complete acceptance of God’s saving grace.

The participatory knowing, the perspectival knowing is all gone. Your sense of self is twisted. All the participatory/perspectival knowing is eradicated and is reduced down to the acceptance of the proposition. And the acceptance cannot in any way be based on evidence or argument, because that would be your mind participating in your salvation. It has to be a radical, pure acceptance. So, the self-negation of Rhineland mystics has come to fruition (in Luther’s ideas).

This means God’s act of saving you is completely arbitrary. There’s nothing that you do, no thought, word or deed that you perform in any way earns or has any causal effect upon God’s behavior. It’s just an arbitrary act of will that saves us. And we have to radically accept that arbitrariness.

Luther is teaching, and putting into our cultural grammar, that we’re inherently worthless and our inner life is one of self-loathing and the only solution to that is arbitrary unearned regard. This is the cultural training for narcissism.

We can see the spirit of Luther in our obsession with Instagram/Snapchat/TikTok. We constantly want unearned positive regard.

Luther protests against the Catholic Church. Because of that the Church also thinks its tradition (the cultural history) is necessary.

Luther advocates that individual conscience (knowing yourself) as the final authority over a person’s spiritual life. The withdrawal of meaning into an isolated individual mind is appropriated as the individual conscience that is the final authority over what matters. Being true to yourself is the ultimate authority. Being true to reality has been superceded by being true to yourself. That’s also emerging with a cultural grammar that’s training us in narcissism.

Knowledge is something that is obtained in the universities that everyone goes to. Applying this knowledge to transform one’s lives, we have wisdom (in places like monasteries) where applying it will help with self-transcendence.

Luther sees that the idea of self-transcendence is the greatest lie that our self tells us. He sees that as the greatest instance of the sin of pride. So, monasteries are being shutdown. But what do we do with the knowledge? What do the universities be tied to? The universities are now tied to the State and the knowledge is tied to politics.

With this, you know where to go for information, you know where to go for knowledge. But you don’t know where to go for wisdom. We have **sapiential obsolescence** of our knowledge. And we have knowledge being inexplicably bound to the machinary of the State and politics. Such that it has become increasingly difficult *right now* for us as a culture to distinguish politics from knowledge from the willful assertion of things that we must simply accept because of an arbitrary *will* wielding power.

This is the protestant reformation. Luther argues that *everybody* has an equal spiritual authority. Because learning, processes of growth, and self-transformation are no longer important criteria. All that matters is the degree to which God has saved someone.

Luther doesn’t propose political democracy, he only proposes democracy within the catholic church. But that is going to get into people’s day-to-day lives experience with democratic processes and decision-making.

With this Luther essentially proposes that people should be treated one way within the church, but differently outside the church. This leads to the separation of church and the state. This further drives the secularization of the culture.

The problem with Luther’s model is that there’s nothing you can do to know you’re saved. Because there’s *nothing* you can do. There’s no causal role, no causal evidence. How do you know if you’re saved. Because God chooses people arbitrarily. This provokes tremendous anxiety. You can’t do anything about it, except working hard and doing good. If you succeed in doing this, that would be a sign that God loves you.

So, the only way I know that I’ll be saved is if I’m succeeding in what I do. So, I’ll work hard and not use any wealth to promote myself. This aligns well with the emerging corporations, the emerging ascendency of the commercial class and we get the advent of capitalism. This is the protestant work ethic.

Luther thinks everybody would read the Bible like he did. But protestantism fragments. This is mainly because each individual has their own spiritual authority. So, people were hungry to be special so that they can get chosen by God and the more they are unlike everybody else and the more they’re special in some way, the closer they get to being saved by God.

By the time of Luther, God is almost non-existent. Shakespeare who comes right after Luther doesn’t have anything about God in any of his plays or writings.

Descartes invents cartesian graphing. This becomes a new psychotechnology. He also invents analytical geometry - any geometric shape can be represented by algebraic equations. Equations capture reality.

Thinking via equations and math puts us deeply in touch with the fiber and contact with reality. It’s not the contact with experience, it’s not Aristotilian, it’s not participatory. It’s purely propositional, it’s purely abstract, it’s purely symbolic.

Descartes understands the meaning crisis as a lack of a search for certainty. Participatory, perspectival conformity is replaced by propositional certainty. So Descartes thinks the answer to the crisis is to transform our minds into machines of certainty - minds that will only work mathematically and logically in terms of equations. So, reasoning is being reduced to computation.

Hobbes disagrees with Descartes and says that cognition is nothing but computation. So, if cognition is computation and I can build a material machine that does computation, I will have made cognition. Hobbes is essentially proposing artificial intelligence in the heart of the scientific revolution. Hobbes kills the soul.
