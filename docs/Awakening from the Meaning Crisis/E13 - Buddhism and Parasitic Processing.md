title: E13 - Buddhism and Parasitic Processing
---

We approach Buddhism via two positions:

1.  we can only interpret Buddhism from within a tradition - if you're not engaged in a transformative practice then you cannot understand Buddhism from within. The problem with this is that it's myopic. There are many people from different cultures and backgrounds that follow Buddhism. The problem with seeing things from the inside is that it's subjective and you see it with your own bias. This approach deals with Transformative Relevance.
2.  Outside any tradition with religious studies. In religious studies one does not engage in practices since they think getting too close to the tradition would make them lose the objectivity and will not be able to critically compare it with other religions. So, this will have an objective account which is contrasting with the other approach. This approach deals with getting at the truth.

Buddhism is about both of these. It's about transformatively relevant truths. How do we do this? We need to do this in a way that's going to be relevant to the issues of meaning in our life. The interpretation crisis (above two points) interacts with the meaning crisis.

Traditionally what Buddhists said is that there are 4 noble truths. These are propositions that are presented to our ears as claims to be believed. These are actually happening at the transformative level, the participatory knowing, the agent-arena relationships. We need to understand these 4 noble truths as a way to afford the transformation. The point is not to believe them. The point is to re-enact the Buddha's enlightenment. If you're not able to "enact" enlighten, then you're not "getting" it.

**4 noble truths (4 enabling provocations)**

(This will have the standard way of understanding the noble truth and then there'll be the reformulation.)

1.  All is suffering.

If this statement were to be believed, then it's false. Suffering is subjective and comparative. Anything that's not absolute cannot be extended to everything.

It doesn't necessarily mean "all *is* suffering". It's actually "all is threatened by suffering".

What does the word suffering mean? The original meaning is mad/insane. Initially mad was associated with anger. That's because anything that causes extreme anger can render you insane - temporarily mad. Anger is a pertinent cause of madness.

People usually think of pain when they hear the word suffering. It's not. To suffer means to undergo, to lose agency. You can actually suffer joy. It's not oxymoronic. You're experiencing so much pleasure that you're losing control of yourself.

Pain is a powerful way of losing agency. Because it's highly disruptive. And pain is associated with damage, and damage is a state where we often lose agency.

Lot of Buddhism is not pain metaphors, they're entrapment metaphors - losing your freedom, losing your agency.

Reformulation: realize that all of your life is threatened with loss of freedom, loss of agency. This is translated to Dukkha. Dukkha is **not** pain.

One of the ways you can lose your agency is with self-destructive practices. You realize that all of your life is existentially threatened by self-deceptive self-destructive behaviors.

The very processes that make you adaptively intelligent also makes you susceptible to self-deceptive self-destructive behaviors.

Let's say you encounter an event. The brain interprets that the event is bad. Then it predicts similar events where this could happen. This is to make you sensitive to such events so that you're well prepared. We use representativeness heuristic and figure out how salient an event is and how much is stands out in our mind. This interacts with availability heuristic.

When you're sad, it triggers a thing called **encoding specificity**. It means, when you're sad it's hard to remember events in which you were happy. It's very easy to remember events where you were sad. Your memory doesn't just store the facts. It stores all the participatory knowing and the state you were in.

Your brain doesn't just store content, it tries to fit it into the environment. There was a study done where two groups of people A and B had to remember words inside of a room. After while, group A remained in the same room and group B went to another room. Group A was able to remember significantly higher number of words just because they were in the same room. Your brain is adaptive.

Going back to the bad event that happened. Your brain finds it difficult to remember happy events when you're feeling sad, so it only remembers bad events. So you judge the probability of bad things happening to increase (this is increase in availability heuristic). And since the bad thing just happened and it's salient, it makes you judge that it's much more probable that it's going to happen (this is increase in representativeness heuristic). And these two are reinforcing each other. All of this is interacting with confirmation bias. So you judge the probability is great. This makes you anxious. What does anxiety do to you? It reduces your cognitive flexibility. Your framing on things become very narrow, very rigid. What does that do? That reduces your ability to solve problems. When that goes down you start to make lots of mistakes and fail. And this increases your anxiety which reinforces that bad events are happening to you.

This is called Parasitic Processing. The bad events explained above is just an example but this kind of spiral is seen in many other scenarios, like depression for instance. It's called Parasitic Processing because it's like a parasite. It takes life within you and it takes life away from you. It causes you to lose your agency. It causes you to suffer.

This is a complex self-organizing system. If you try to intervene anywhere, it reorganizes itself. It can adapt and preserve itself as you try to destroy it. Why? Because it's making use of the same machinery by which you adapt and make use of the things that trying to destroy you.

Addiction is primarily the loss of agency. We describe somebody's addiction by how dysfunctional they become. The way we define addiction is fundamentally wrong. We see it as a dependency on a chemical. And when our body doesn't get that chemical, we seek it out. But there doesn't need to be a biochemical dependency. For example, soldiers in Vietnam War were addicted to heroin. They came back to the US and vast majority of them gave up their addiction.

If you look at it from an agent-arena perspective, they were assuming an identity (agent) in Vietnam where there was a war (arena). When they came back to the US, their identity changed to citizen (agent) during peacetime (arena). The relationship between the agent and the arena is what is fundamentally altered in what causes addiction.

This leads to Reciprocal Narrowing. In the agent-arena combination, during addiction the options start reducing which leads to decrease in cognitive flexibility and the agent and the arena reciprocally narrow and you have no options as to who you could be and how the world could be. And that's addiction.

The reciprocal narrowing is the spiraling down. The opposite of that is spiraling up, and that's anagoge. That's path to enlightenment.

Parasitic Processing and reciprocal narrowing are enforcing each other. That's Dukkha. And no matter where you turn, this is always threatening. You can't run away from it. You can't deny it.

You *should* feel threatened about what is described above. If so, then you will start to enact the process of moving towards enlightenment, rather than just asserting some propositions that are largely inert.

1.  Suffering is caused by desire.

Reformulation: realize that Dukkha is caused if you're attached, which doesn't mean you really like something. It means a sense of a narrowing of your self and the world so that agency and options are lost.

1.  The cessation of suffering is attainable.

Reformulation: realize that you can recover your agency. Realize that this complex machinery reduces the capacity for self deception. How can this be addressed? By psycho-technology of practices. So how do you deal with complex dynamic systems that are operating against you? By counteracting with a dynamical system that is operating for you. For example, failed relationships - we know that we make specific mistakes and then we get into another relationship and make the same mistake. That's because if you intervene in one place in the dynamical system, it adjusts and you end up making the same mistake again. But if you create a dynamical system that intervene in multiple places at the same time, and it didn't just operate at the level of your beliefs but operated at the state your consciousness and your traits of the character. That's what the Buddha offered. He offered the 8-fold path.

The 8-fold path is an attempt to give you a counter-active dynamical system that can deal with Parasitic Processing and to reverse the reciprocal narrowing and to get the anagogic awakening that takes you beyond the prison of the ego in the everyday world.
