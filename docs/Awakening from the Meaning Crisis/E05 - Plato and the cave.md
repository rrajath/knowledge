title: E05 - Plato and the cave

Plato divides the human psyche into 3 parts:

-   the man: represented in the head of the human body. Its function is to seek truth, reason, logic.
-   the monster: represented in the stomach region. It deals with pleasure and pain.
-   the lion: represent in the chest region which symbolizes honor and shame.

Shame and guilt must not be confused. Guilt is when you realize you failed to meet your own ideal of who you should be. Shame is when you feel you've lost the capacity to get respect in society and among your peers.

Diacounting is a concept where the higher you discount something the less salient it becomes. For example, there's a task you want to do tomorrow and there's one that needs to be done 3 months from now. The latter is discounted highly because it occurs far in the future making it less salient.

Discounting is necessary for your adaptive machinery to function so that you can provide things with the right kind of attention. However, people with anxiety have a problem with discounting and make the wrong things salient.

Hyperbolic discounting is where a collection of low probability events far in the future are perceived as low risk (which they are) but the individual fails to see the implications of them when viewed collectively.

For example, someone who smokes cigarettes has a bunch of low probability events for how they're going to die (what kind of cancer, where they die, when they die, etc.) Now this individual doesn't want to avoid a particular death, but they want to avoid death in the abstract. Hyperbolic discounting blinds the individual to specific low probability events. And in doing so it blinds them to what they all have in common which is premature death. By blinding the individual to premature death, the adaptive machinery makes them take another puff and sets them on a course to cancer.

So, the very machinery that makes you adaptive makes you prey to self deceptive, self destructive behavior. But you can't throw this machinery away, because of you do then you'll have crippling anxiety. And if you let it run without any control then you'll indulge in self-deceptive, self-destructive behavior.

We developed the ability to form abstract thought, to abstract what is in common in the distant future, and make it symbolic to us. That's what 'the man' does. 'The lion' cannot do this. The lion doesn't have the ability for abstract thought and reason. So 'the man' can tame 'the lion' and together they can tame'the monster'.

So with the teaching of the man, the training of the lion and the taming of the monster, we reduce as much as possible the inner conflict. You'd want these 3 to be in perfect coordination and let them grow individually as much as possible without affecting others. This is called an optimization strategy. This mutuality, for Plato, is to experience a fullness of being. It's also to experience a kind of peace because your inner conflict has dropped. This would be a meta drive for people. They want to have what they're after without having inner conflict.

When we reduce inner conflict, the self-deception goes down and I'm no longer egocentric. This results in being more in touch with reality, thereby having clearer vision. With clearer vision I can pick up real patterns in the world, which I can apply to myself. I can better teach the man, train the lion and tame the monster.

Self transformation and getting more in contact with the world are interconnected. I'm not an impartial passive observer that looks at the world and forms beliefs and opinions. I'm an active participant. I have to change myself to view the world more clearly and the world changes and puts a demand on me to change myself. This goes on in a cycle. This is **participatory knowing**.

**Anagoge** is a cycle of enlightenment where you pick up on real patterns that challenge you. It blinds you and you transform yourself to pick them up. And then you're enabled to confront them and move forward and the cycle repeats.

Plato discusses form which does not mean just the structure or the feature list of a thing. It's the structural functional organization of that thing. The German word for it is gestalt. The Greek word for it is logos. For example, when asked what a bird is, one would say it has wings, feathers, beak and it can fly. But these conditions can be satisfied by attaching them to an object like a table and throwing it in the air. The real patterns we pick up makes us learn intuitively what a bird is by recognizing its gestalt but when we're asked to explain it (ie explain the logos) we can't. The sfo of a bird is not just about how the bird is, it's about how you understand it. The sfo of a thing transcends the sum of its parts.
